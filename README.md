<h1>Summer Research Machine Learning Project</h1>

<p>

<b>Research Question </b>: Can supervised learning neural networks, using advanced embedding techniques (e.g.
doc2vec), outperform the arXiv’s API in auto-classification? 
<p>
<p> 
<b>Research Objective </b>: Design and implement machine-learning algorithms using neural networks to auto-classify arXiv preprints and compare performance against, and potentially outperform, the benchmark metrics provided by arXiv’s in-house ML team. <p>
  
<b>Project Summary:</b> The arXiv is a preprint repository for research articles in several fields, including
mathematics. When a preprint is submitted, the author must choose a category and
subcategory—e.g. math.GT, where math is the category and GT (geometric topology) is
the subcategory. The project is to design an algorithm using recent machine learning
techniques, based on neural networks, to take as input a preprint and output a category
and subcategory, thereby auto-classifying preprints. The arXiv recently released an API
for auto-classification using older, well-established techniques. The goal of the project is
to use this API as the benchmark and to see if more modern techniques can improve
performance. In the process, we will explore several potential designs.

<b>Learning Objectives </b>: Students will learn the basic theory of neural networks, best practices in machine
learning, vector embedding techniques, how to engineer various models, to work with
industry-standard programming tools (including Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, vscode, ssh),
how to work with and manage big data, how to manage/design a large-scale project
and the associated workflow, how to design experiments and test hypotheses, and
how to work both in a team and independently.
